To make navigation easier, I am utilizing themes (native support on Github) for CSS. I installed this on my own PC using Ruby and Jekyll.

I don't really know what Ruby IS but it's apparently required to be installed to test this locally. So install I shall.
(Same goes for Jekyll.)

To test it, open a Command prompt in the directory and type:
	Jekyll serve

Then test it by going to:
	http://localhost:4000/

After you're done, you may delete .jekyll-cache, and _site. These are generated by Jekyll when testing.

Every page needs this text at the very top in order to automatically appear on the navbar and utilize a theme:
	---
	layout: default
	title: "Home"
	nav_exclude: false
	interactive_tool_content: |
 	 <div class="interactive-tool">
   		 <!-- Your interactive tool code goes here -->
 	 </div>
	---

	<!-- Your page's main content goes here -->

Change "false" to "true" if you want it to appear on the navbar.
You may also refer to PageTemplate.html to see how a page should be formatted.
